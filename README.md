  ## Lemon, Gorgonzola & Spinach Pasta
  Ingredients

    1. 1 Tbsp Olive oil
    2. 350g (12.4oz) Spaghetti
    3. 4 cloves of garlic, crushed
    4. 15 kalamata olives, sliced
    5. 250g (8.8oz) of fresh spinach leaves, washed
    6. 1 lemon, juiced and zested
    7. A few handfuls of fresh torn basil leaves
    8. 150g (5.3oz) crumbled gorgonzola

        Start cooking your spaghetti according to the package instructions.
    Meanwhile, prepare your spinach. In a large, wide pan or skillet, heat olive oil and saute your garlic, lemon zest and olives for a couple of minutes until the garlic is soft.
    Add the spinach, 1-2 handfuls at a time. Stir through the garlic mixture, and as the spinach wilts, you will have room to add more. Once all of the spinach is in the pan, add the lemon juice and mix through.
    Once the spaghetti is cooked, use a mug to take a little bit of the cooking water out of the pan and set aside.
    Add the spaghetti to the spinach. Over a low heat, mix through the spinach mixture and then add the basil and blue cheese. Keeping mixing with a low heat, until the blue cheese melts.
    Serve!
